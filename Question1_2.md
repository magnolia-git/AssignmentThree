Parameters, Random Numbers, and Simple Graphics
1. True/False questions
*a) True.
int i only exists in the scope of the method it exists in. The value of i can be returned, but not the variable itself.
*b) True.
While a variable named x in the method's caller can be used as an argument for a parameter named x, that doesn't mean said variable has to have a direct relationship. For example, a different variable named y can be used as an argument for parameter x. Only the value of the variable in the parameter gets copied to be used in the method being called.

2. Tracing method execution
For the program below, trace through its execution by hand to show what output is
produced when it runs.
*Output:
*snitch: x = 4004, y = 1001
*quaffle: x = 2003, y = 1, z = 1001
*bludger: x = 1001, y = 2001, z = 2003
